The Local Group is a galaxy group that includes the Milky Way (MW) and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), among other smaller galaxies.
The Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy are the two most massive members, together containing most of the mass of the group.

The dynamics within the Local Group provide insights into galaxy formation and evolution. 
As it contains some of the closest galaxies, the Local Group allows for detailed astronomical observations that are not possible with more distant galaxies.

 The Local Group is relatively isolated from other galaxy groups. 
 The Local Group's peculiar velocity (motion relative to the cosmic microwave background) keeps it somewhat isolated as it moves relative to this general expansion.
